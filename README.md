# PokedexClone

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

## Getting Started

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Project info

This is a slice app I tried to put together quickly to utilize the public api [Pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/). It is an SPA using Angular14 and the Angular Material Libraries.

## Future plans

I may add more to this small application, but for now I have established displaying data from an external API.
